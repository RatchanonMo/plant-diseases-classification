Distributed with the water used to water the plants. Should adjust the condition of the house to be transparent Distance allows the wind to blow through easily.<br/><br/><b>Solution :</b><br/>1.) Burn and destroy diseased plants. <br/>2.) Cut off the uninfected parts. The scissors used for cutting should be sterilized by flame or dipped in alcohol. When cut, it is painted with red cement to prevent germs from entering. <br/>3.) Use anti-fungal medication Once a week is a mencozeb such as manseb200, ditanM45 <br/>4.)

Often occurring during wet weather, downy mildew causes the upper portion of leaves to discolor, while the bottoms develop white or gray mold.<br/><br/><b>Solution :</b><br/> Plant resistant cultivars when available. No fungicides are available, but cultural practices can help. Remove and destroy infected foliage, or entire plants if downy mildew is prevalent. Avoid crowding plants or watering them in the evening, and rotate edibles year to year.</div>",

Also, give plants good drainage and ample air circulation. Avoid overhead watering at night; mid-morning is preferred to allow foliage to dry before evening. Commercial fungicides are available for powdery mildew, or you can spray with a solution of one tsp. baking soda and one quart of water as recommended by George ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù and Katy Abraham, authors of The Green Thumb Garden Handbook.</div>",

On leaves it‚Äôs not only unsightly; it impedes photosynthesis and stunts plant growth. Leaves coated with sooty mold also drop off prematurely. <br/><br/><b>Solution :</b><br/> To deal with sooty mold, you have to deal with the plant-sucking insects leaving the honeydew, such as aphids, leafhoppers and mealybugs. Spray them with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Ants are attracted to the honeydew for food, so they protect the plant-sucking insects from predatory insects that would otherwise keep a lid on the pest population. Trap ants or, with woody plants, paint a sticky compound such as Tanglefoot around stems.</div>",
